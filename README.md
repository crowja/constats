Tools for evaluating RNA-seq assemblies

__Update Sep 2018__. After six years I see the Samtools libs I
counted on are no longer. At some point it would make sense to
rewrite [in terms of HTSlib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib).
Right now I don't have any pressing need to do so, but let me
know if you do and, ideally, have an interest in helping.
